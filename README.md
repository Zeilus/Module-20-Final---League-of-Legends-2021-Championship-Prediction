# Module 20 Final - League of Legends 2021 Championship Prediction
 Final project

Using a public data set of current teams and players match records to predict the winner of League of Legends 2021 Worlds Championship. 

The variables that will be used to predict the viability of a team winning will be based on each team members:

- Role (role in team comp)
- Champions used (characters played)
- Average kill count
- Average death count
- Average assist count
- Creep Score (mobs killed)
- Gold earned per match (currency used to power character)

Each variable will be given a numerical value based on their impact to the overall final result of a match, that will be called an impact value, and the sum total of each team members impact value will be used to 
compare each team and determine the viability of a team winning.

The final product will be a website that can show who is favorable to win with the user inputting the name of two teams to compare against each other.
